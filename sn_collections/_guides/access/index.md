If you have recieved your login credentials in an email, this guide will help you get connected to SCINet.  Otherwise, please email the Virtual Research Support Core at [scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV](mailto:scinet_vrsc@USDA.GOV?subject=account%20access) for assistance. <!--excerpt-->

Note that home directories on Atlas are not created right away, so if you are a new SCINet user, we recommend you wait a day after receiving the email with your SCINet credentials before logging on to the Atlas cluster.
