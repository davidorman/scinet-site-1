Developed and presented by the University of Florida and customized for USDA-ARS with funding from ARSâ€™s AI Center of Excellence, *Practicum AI* is a hands-on applied artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, the program starts from introductory content and builds your AI knowledge, enabling you to design and conduct AI work. **Starting this fall, the University of Florida Research Computing team will be offering a series of courses to help ARS researchers begin using AI.** In January, a more advanced course on computer vision will be offered.
