time: 9am-12pm CT
lead: ARS SCINet Office


section: November 21, Morning â€” Applications of AI

prerequisites:
  - text: Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts. The workshop on November 20 will provide this background, if needed.
  - text: Familiarity with basic Python concepts and Jupyter notebooks. We will offer virtual training for these skills before the Forum begins.

This workshop will teach participants the concepts and tools they need to begin applying modern, deep learning-based computer vision methods to their own scientific research. This will be an interactive, hands-on workshop that will offer plenty of opportunities for practice and experiential learning. By the end of the session, participants will have trained and evaluated a state-of-the-art image classification model on a custom image dataset.<!--excerpt--> 

## Tutorial setup instruction

Steps to prepare for the tutorial:

1. **Login to Atlas Open OnDemand** at [https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/). For more information on login procedures for web-based SCINet access, see the [SCINet access user guide]({{site.baseurl}}/guides/access/web-based-login).

1. **Open a command-line session** by clicking on "Clusters" -> "Atlas Shell Access" on the top menu. This will open a new tab with a command-line session on Atlas's login node.

1. **Request resources on a compute node** by running the following command: 

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
    srun --reservation=forum -A scinet_workshop1 -t 00:30:00 -n 1 --mem 8G --pty bash 
    ```

1. **Create and/or update your workshop working directory** and copy the tutorial materials into it by running the following commands. Note: you do not have to edit the commands with your username as it will be determined by the `$USER` variable. 

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /90daydata/shared/$USER/computer_vision1
    cd /90daydata/shared/$USER/computer_vision1
    cp -r /project/ai_forum/computer_vision1/computer_vision_1.ipynb .
    cp -r /project/ai_forum/computer_vision1/*.py .
    ```

1. **Setup the kernel for JupyterLab.** You will create a kernel called *computer_vision_1_env* to access from JupyterLab Server. Run the following commands to activate the workshop's virtual environment and create a new kernelspec from it:

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
    source /project/ai_forum/computer_vision1/computer_vision_1_env/bin/activate
    ipython kernel install --name "computer_vision_1_env" --user
    ```

1. **Stop the interactive job** on the compute node by running the command:

    {:.copy-code}
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

1. **Launch a JupyterLab Server session.** Under the *Interactive Apps* menu, select *JupyterLab Server*. Specify the following input values on the page:

    * Account: scinet_workshop1
    * Partition: gpu-a100-mig7
    * QOS: normal 14-00:00:00
    * Number of hours: 4
    * Number of nodes: 1
    * Number of tasks: 2
    * Additional Slurm Parameters: 
        
        {: .copy-code }
        ```
--reservation=forum-gpu --gres=gpu:1 --mem=32G --ntasks-per-node=2
```
    * Working Directory: 
        
        {: .copy-code }
        ```
/90daydata/shared/${USER}/computer_vision1
```
  
    Click *Launch*. The screen will update to the *Interactive Sessions* page. When your Jupyter session is ready, the top card will update from *Queued* to *Running* and a *Connect to JupyterLab Server* button will appear. Click *Connect to JupyterLab Server*.

1. **Open the `computer_vision_1.ipynb` notebook.**
  
1. **Select the `computer_vision_1_env` kernel** for the notebook.
