This pre-workshop session will have a VRSC team member available to address any issues related to SCINet account logins. If you don't currently have a SCINet account, [apply for one]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/signup) ASAP. 

You must be [able to login]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access) to your SCINet account to actively participate in the tutorial sessions. If it has been a while since you logged in to your account, please confirm that you are able to login. Your password has likely expired. If your password is expired, please [reset it]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/faq/#how-do-i-reset-or-change-my-password). If you are unable to reset your password because you do not remember your expired password, you will need to ask VRSC for help by emailing <scinet_vrsc@usda.gov> and/or attending this session.

We can also address questions related to uploading files to Ceres or Atlas for the Bring-Your-Own-Problem sessions.
