Practicum AIâ€™s Computer Vision Course builds on a basic understanding of Python and deep neural networks to demystify the technology that allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data.<!--excerpt--> We will explore image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks. Each module in this course will provide hands-on experiences to create your own working models. By the end, you'll be ready to instantiate and employ a computer vision model to make predictions.

**Prerequisites:** This course assumes familiarity with Jupyter notebooks, basic Python programming, and a general understanding of neural networks and deep learning. The Practicum AI Beginner Series provides this foundation.
