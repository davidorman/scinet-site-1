title: "Demonstration: Species distribution modeling with MaxEnt"
description: Provides hands-on tutorials on workflows to access the SCINet HPC systems and conduct geospatial research at scale and fosters geospatial research efforts.
excerpt: "During this session, we will explore the topic of species distribution / environmental niche modeling (SDM/ENM), with a particular focus on MaxEnt (maximum entropy), a popular SDM/ENM algorithm used to estimate species habitats from presence-only occurrence records."

During this session, we will explore the topic of species distribution / environmental niche modeling (SDM/ENM), with a particular focus on MaxEnt (maximum entropy), a popular SDM/ENM algorithm used to estimate species habitats from presence-only occurrence records. 

A recording of the demonstration will be added after the workshop concludes.
