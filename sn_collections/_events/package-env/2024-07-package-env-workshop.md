Package and computing environment management systems for R, Python, and Anaconda make it easy to install the software you need for your research projects. They also make it easy to accidentally use up all of the space in your home directory or end up with frustrating software conflicts! 

In this workshop presented by the SCINet Office, we will cover best practices for managing software packages and computing environments on SCINet’s supercomputers. This will be a hands-on workshop that will provide you with the practical knowledge and skills you need to spend less time worrying about package management and more time focusing on your research! 

At least some experience with the command line will be helpful for working through the exercises.
