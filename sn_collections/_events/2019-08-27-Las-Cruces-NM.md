A group of 12 researchers including ecologists and data scientists representing ARS and collaborating University partners met at the ARS Jornada Rangeland Research Unit in Las Cruces, NM in August 2019 to learn how the use of SCINet and CERES could expand the scope and impact of an on-going collaborative research project.<!--excerpt--> Participants devised workflows to assemble multiple diverse data streams representing growing season dynamics and ecosystem productivity for agro-ecosystems nationwide at multiple spatial scales. SCINet and CERES will facilitate the development and optimization of models to characterize seasonal carbon dynamics in agroecosystems in the LTAR network. The first report of this work will be presented at the 2019 Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. Contact Dawn Browning for more information on this research and collaborative opportunities.
