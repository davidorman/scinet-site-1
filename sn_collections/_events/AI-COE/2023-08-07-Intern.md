The first year of the AI Center of Excellence (AI-COE)/SCINet Graduate Student Internships Program is coming to a close as our summer interns wrap up their research projects with their ARS mentors. In total, we had 26 graduate students participate in summer or spring internships with ARS researchers this year. This year’s interns were affiliated with the New College of Florida; the University of Florida; North Carolina State University; or the AI Institute for Food Systems, a multi-university partnership headquartered at the University of California, Davis. They were primarily from data science and computer science degree programs and were paired with ARS researchers for projects that could benefit from the intern’s computational skills. 

To recognize the efforts of these students, we are holding an internships research symposium on August 7, 2023 from 11am-5pm EDT. Anyone interested in attending this virtual event can join using [this Zoom link](https://www.zoomgov.com/j/1604079194?pwd=b2t0NlJkZFJ6OVVmYnMrdklkaWhJQT09). 

We will continue this AI-COE-funded internship program next year and a call for mentors will be sent out in the fall. Many thanks to the students who dedicated their time and hard work to these internships, the ARS scientists who volunteered to serve as internship mentors, and the universities who have partnered with us for this pilot internships program.
