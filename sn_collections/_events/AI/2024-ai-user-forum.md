**Forum Goal:** To advance the appropriate and impactful use of AI tools, techniques, and infrastructure across the ARS, REE, and USDA research portfolio. <!--excerpt-->

 

## Objectives
* **Demonstrate Relevance** – Exposing researchers at all skill levels to the potential of AI tools through compelling case studies and examples.  
  * *What is AI and how/why should I use it as a federal employee?*  
  * *How can AI streamline my research and increase my impact?*  
* **Build Connections** – Helping users connect, network with and learn from their colleagues and collaborators.  
  * *Who are the current users of AI tools in my agency?*  
* **Inspire Agility** – Sparking the imagination of researchers and technicians driving new research impact through adoption and appropriate use of AI tools in research.   
  * *Using new tools, what new research questions could I ask and how can I have more impact?*  
* **Catalyze Innovation**– Fostering collaborative innovation by making practical, hands-on training opportunities to ensure appropriate and impactful use.  
  * *What is it that I need to know and where do I start?*  
  * *What enablers does REE have access to and what’s missing?*  

## Workshops

Training workshops are planned for the final two days of the forum. You will be able to choose from the following when submitting your online registration. Note that space is limited, so each workshop has a registration cap.

{% include alert type="info" title="About Workshop Prerequisites" text="The technical workshops each have one or more required prerequisite skills. If you do not yet have the prerequisite skills for a workshop, please do not let that deter you from signing up! We will offer opportunities for workshop registrants to learn all required prerequisite skills. In some cases, this will be through other workshops offered at the Forum. In other cases, this will be through virtual training options that we will offer in the weeks leading up to the Forum. We will contact workshop registrants about these pre-Forum training opportunities." %}
