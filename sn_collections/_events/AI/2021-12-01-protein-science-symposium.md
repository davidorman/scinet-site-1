Computational methods for investigating protein structure and function have advanced rapidly in recent years, including the development of new methods and software tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. These methodological advances will open doors to new research opportunities in plant breeding, functional genomics, insecticide/antimicrobial molecule discovery, and a host of other topics that will significantly impact US Agriculture.

At this two-day symposium and conference, we learned about recent computational advances in protein science and potential applications of these new methods to agricultural research.  We also learned about protein-related research already underway at ARS, and we discussed new opportunities for AI-powered, protein-related science at ARS and strategies for pursuing those opportunities.
