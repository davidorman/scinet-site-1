Are you interested in AI-based image analysis methods for scientific research?  If so, please join us for an AI training images workshop at the end of February!  <!--excerpt-->
What are “AI training images”?  AI-based image analysis techniques typically require relatively large image datasets – “training images” – to help the AI system improve its performance on a given analysis task.  Obtaining suitable training images is often one of the most expensive and time-consuming aspects of applying AI image analyses in scientific research. 

On February 28, 2023, from 12-4 pm EST, ARS’s AI Center of Excellence will host a virtual workshop to help lay the foundations for building shared AI training image resources for ARS research.  
We will: 
* Help attendees gain a better understanding of AI image analysis methods, how they are used in ARS, and why we need agency-wide training image resources.
* Identify training image requirements and use cases.
* Begin to develop an inventory of extant training image datasets.  

At the beginning of the workshop, we will host a lightning talk session for attendees to share their work using AI-based image analyses.  If you would like to attend the workshop, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/g/a7XH90hQsb).
