Ceres cluster maintenance is scheduled for June 17-21, 2024 (the week of Juneteenth).

During the maintenance, the following major modifications to Ceres will take place in addition to the usual maintenance items:

* System software updates:
  * Ceres will be transitioned from running Alma Linux to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
  * Infiniband switches will be updated.
* Storage:
  * A new Vast storage will be added to the cluster
  * The new storage will eventually replace existing storage hardware.
  * Data will not be moved to the new storage during the maintenance.
* Hardware management:
  * Old ethernet switches will be removed.
* IPA migration:
  * The identity management system will be migrated to a new domain.
  * Some users will need to perform a one-time account migration action after the maintenance.


Queued jobs will not start if they cannot complete by 6AM June 17. In the output of the squeue command the reason for those jobs will state (ReqNodeNotAvail, Reserved for maintenance). The jobs will start after the scheduled outage completes.

The Atlas cluster will be available during the Ceres maintenance. Make sure to copy data from Ceres to Atlas prior to the maintenance, if needed.
