The Atlas compute cluster is scheduled for downtime/upgrade beginning April 30 at 6am Central and lasting through May 1.
A downtime is required to repair a chilled water line for the cooling system. Lack of cooling during this repair will necessitate the shutdown of Atlas.

Taking advantage of this shutdown, the operating system on Atlas will be upgraded from CentOS 7.8 to the Rocky 9.x distribution of Linux. This upgrade will also present a newer software stack. Users may need to recompile their software.

The Ceres system will not be affected by this maintenance.

An announcement will be made once the system is returned to operational status.

Any issues/problems should be addressed to the help desk.
