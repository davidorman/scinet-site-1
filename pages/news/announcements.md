  - title: "Atlas OOD terminal"
    date: 2024-07-02
    excerpt: "When in [Open OnDemand on Atlas](https://atlas-ood.hpc.msstate.edu/), the terminal created by clicking on *Clusters* > *Atlas Shell Access* no longer prompts users to re-authenticate."
  - title: "SCINet Login Updates"
    date: 2024-06-26
    excerpt: "Legacy authentication using SCINet usernames, passwords, and authentication codes is no longer supported. Access to SCINet is now limited to authentication with a LincPass or a Login.gov account, with the exception of some sponsored accounts still using YubiKey devices. These accounts will be transitioned to Login.gov over the next few months. See detailed instructions on our [Logging Into SCINet Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access)."
  - title: "Ceres OS upgraded"
    date: 2024-06-26
    excerpt: "The Linux distribution on Ceres has been changed from AlmaLinux to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2. This should not cause complications with previously installed software or workflows."
  - title: "SCINet Login Updates"
    date: 2024-06-17
    excerpt: "Getting collaborators set up with sponsored SCINet accounts is now much quicker because non-LincPass holders can use Login.gov credentials. We are no longer relying on the physical devices, YubiKeys, that had to be mailed to such users. See detailed instructions on our [Logging Into SCINet Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/guides/access)."
