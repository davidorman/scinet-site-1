The focus of this group is to create a space where researchers working on addressing problems in breeding using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods can exchange knowledge and build community support. This group uses a “train the trainers” approach towards addressing the need for data standardization and protocols for transfer of research material to SCINet. The group is composed of both scientists already using SCINet resources and scientists interested in expanding utilization of SCINet in their research. This group will investigate, discover, and share learning resources for ARS scientists to promote both the development of AI/ML data and models. Eventually a repository will be made available for material developed in this space.

 

This working group supports the Digital Ag Science Hub (DASH) effort within USDA focused at enterprising phenotyping solutions across breeding and production research space.
