The AGR working group focuses on outreach within USDA-ARS aimed at enhancing the genomic analyse knowledge and skill sets of members and collaborators. This is delivered through monthly teleconferences and webinars by internal and external scientists focused on genome assembly, gene and protein expression, population genomics, and reverse genetic (RNAi and CRISPR) approaches. The AGR was initiated following two organizational meetings in 2014 ([AGR Workshop I](/events/2014-09-17-Arthropod-Genomic-Research-Workshop)) and 2016 ([AGR Workshop II]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/2016-07-26-Arthropod-Genomics-Workshop)), at which participants communicated needs and devised solutions for challenging analytical pipelines. The AGR facilitates internal and external collaborations by merging those with complementary knowledge, skills, and capabilities within a given research area. Collaborations among AGR members have also resulted in two published papers reviewing ARS arthropod genomics research<sup>1</sup> and developing RNAi and CRISPR technologies<sup>2</sup>.  Work within the AGR includes the Ag100Pest Initiative, which aims to provide reference quality genome sequence assemblies for arthropod pests of U.S. agricultural commodities.

The AGR is open to anyone within ARS, and those interested in joining can contact Brad Coates.

## Symposia

### Arthropod Genomics Symposium X (AGSx) Virtual Spring Symposium 2022

*Online: [http://i5k.github.io/agsx2022](http://i5k.github.io/agsx2022)*  
*Webinar postings: [https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community/videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/i5k_community/videos)*

The ARS AGR working group along with the [i5K Community](http://i5k.github.io/), an international consortium committed to the sequencing of 5000 arthropod genomes, hosted the [AGSx Virtual Symposium Spring 2022](http://i5k.github.io/agsx2022) from February through May, 2022. This was the second annual AGSx event. The 2022 AGSx was comprised of four sessions co-organized and moderated by ARS AGR members and researchers from other domestic and international research institutions. Each session highlighted presentations from subject matter experts, including four from ARS researchers, and facilitated open discussions and technology transfer.

1.  Insect genomic Technologies to Improve Food Applications, by [Dr. Brenda Oppert](https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/mhk/cgahr/spieru/people/brenda-oppert/), USDA-ARS
2.  Honeybee Workshop, by [Dr. Alain Vignal](https://genphyse.toulouse.inra.fr/people/vignal), and [Dr. Sonia Eynard](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CAloEFcAAAAJ&hl=en), INRAE, France
3.  Arthropod Genomics and Genome Engineering, by [Dr. Lindsey Perkin](https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person?person-id=53466), USDA-ARS 
4.  Application of New Genomics Tools and Techniques in Arthropods by [Dr. Marcé Lorenzen](https://cals.ncsu.edu/entomology-and-plant-pathology/people/mdlorenz/), North Carolina State University

There were 321 participations across all four AGSx 2022 sessions. The majority of attendees were from the United States, but AGSx reached a global audience inclusive of scientists in Asia, Europe, South America, and Africa.
