This working group was formed as the result of an August 2019 SCINet-funded workshop hosted by Dawn Browning. The focus of the group is to learn how to use SCINet high performance computing resources to expand the scope and impact of on-going collaborative phenology research. The group is devising workflows to assemble multiple diverse data streams and using SCINet computing resources to optimize agroecosystem models. 

Contact Dawn Browning for more information on this research and collaborative opportunities.
