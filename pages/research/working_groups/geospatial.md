This working group was formed as the result of a September 2019 SCINet-funded workshop hosted by Deb Peters, the acting ARS Chief Science Information Officer. The focus of the group is to provide continued input on the development of SCINet, to determine the computational needs of ARS geospatial researchers, and to develop collaborative research projects. The group will also learn from each other on topics related to high-performance computing. For example, how to use Ceres (the ARS high-performance computer), optimizing code for parallel processing, getting software onto Ceres, etc. Monthly working group teleconference calls and working sessions are beginning soon. 

If you would like to join the group, please contact Heather Savoy to be added to the groupâ€™s Teams.

## Geospatial Workbook
This working group contributes content to the 
[Geospatial Workbook](https://geospatial.101workbook.org), a site dedicated to
providing practical geospatial tutorials for SCINet users. Tutorials
from our previous workshops and other meetings are available there for general use.
