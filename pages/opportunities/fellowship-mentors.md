## Overview

The SCINet Program, in collaboration with the ARS Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AI-COE), is calling for proposals for funding to support postdoctoral fellows to be mentored by ARS scientists. The goal of the fellowships program is to develop the next generation of ARS scientists with expertise in conducting and leading individual and collaborative research using computationally intensive approaches. For examples of successful proposal topics, please see the titles of the postdoctoral fellowship proposals funded in [FY2024]({{ site.baseurl }}/opportunities/fellowship-mentors/fy24-awards), [FY2023]({{ site.baseurl }}/opportunities/fellowship-mentors/fy23-awards), and [FY2022]({{ site.baseurl }}/opportunities/fellowship-mentors/fy22-awards). 

Each fellow should: (1) be involved in individual and collaborative, multi-unit research that includes substantial computational work and that will leverage SCINet's computing infrastructure; (2) have training and leadership opportunities; and (3) contribute to the overall success of SCNet or the AI-COE and the SCINet/AI-COE Fellowships Program. In addition, each fellow will have the opportunity to take advantage of training courses that build computational literacy, such as in data science, AI, bioinformatics, and geospatial analyses on SCINet's high-performance computing clusters (Ceres, Atlas).

All fellows will receive a competitive stipend and travel support. Fellowships are funded for two years. **The mentor is expected to provide the fellow's laptop, office space, and laboratory space (if needed).**


## Proposal format and submission

All proposals must be submitted using the [online submission form](https://forms.office.com/g/XvP71bTAia). The PI's RL or supervisor must approve the proposal prior to submission (approval will be indicated on the submission form).

All proposals must use [the fellowships proposal template](https://usdagcc.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/REE-ARS-SCINetOffice/EXfbBIAM9vpPrFGXowAYsSwBYJBAwCtwI3UDWWprN0yM-w?e=uznaVH). Please follow the instructions in the template and do not change the section headings or document formatting. The final proposal must be **no more than 750 words, including the headings**.
 
**Deadline for proposal submission:** Close of business on Friday, December 6, 2024.
 
**Eligibility:** ARS Category 1, 4, or 6 scientists with RL or supervisor approval. Please note that lead mentors on FY24 awards are not eligible for an FY25 award.
