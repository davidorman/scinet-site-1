## Overview

The ARS Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AI-COE) and SCINet are seeking ARS scientists who wish to serve as graduate student internship mentors in the spring or summer of 2025. We want each of our interns to have an outstanding experience, which means we need outstanding ARS mentors and research projects! (Application instructions are below.) 

This program has three primary goals: 

* Bring new AI, machine learning (ML), data science, and/or computer science (CS) expertise to ARS research. 
* Enhance the educational experience of our student participants. 
* Increase awareness of agricultural research with ARS as an exciting career path for data scientists and computer scientists. 

We work with partner universities to recruit students with AI, ML, data science, or CS expertise and pair them with ARS research projects and mentors, based on the interests of the students and available research opportunities. ARS researchers who have previously participated as mentors have overwhelmingly reported that serving as an internship mentor was a rewarding experience that benefited their research program. 

## Program logistics
ARS scientists who wish to serve as a mentor must submit an application by Friday, December 6, 2024 (see detailed instructions below). When the application deadline closes, all applications are reviewed by ARS leadership. Applications that are accepted are placed into a pool of available internship opportunities. The SCINet Office then works with our partner universities to recruit graduate student participants, but our university collaborators are responsible for choosing the final set of interns. We then use an algorithmic process to optimally match students with internship opportunities based on the students' interests. Again, please note that ARS mentors are not responsible for recruiting interns, and we will not be able to accept or fund interns who are not recruited through our partner universities. ARS mentors also are not responsible for managing stipend or travel funding payments. The SCINet Office, in collaboration with our partner institutions, will take care of all funds management. 

Most internships are 10-week internships that take place over the summer, but there are typically also a small number of spring semester internships. Each internship includes a competitive stipend and travel funding for the participant to spend time onsite with their ARS mentor(s). Internships are intended to be hybrid remote/in-person experiences with most of the internship completed remotely but up to two weeks spent onsite at the ARS mentorâ€™s research location. Please note that geographic location will not be a factor in selecting ARS mentors for these internships. Our intent is for these internships to be available for any ARS research location. 

At the end of the summer, all interns are expected to participate in our day-long internships symposium. This is a virtual event that gives the students an opportunity to present their research and practice answering questions from a live audience. 

## Application format and submission

All applications must be submitted using the [online submission form](https://forms.office.com/g/ZMY46KTQnT). The lead mentor's RL or supervisor must approve the application prior to submission (approval will be indicated on the submission form). 

All applications must use the [application template](https://usdagcc.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/REE-ARS-SCINetOffice/EQaVFicsiVZAphaYty7Sh7EBeb-UKo3qQ1hVyybwk3jIBQ). Please follow the instructions in the template and do not change the section headings or document formatting. The final application must be **no more than one page in length**. 
 
**Deadline for application submission:** Close of business on Friday, December 6, 2024.
 
**Eligibility:** ARS Category 1, 4, or 6 scientists with RL or supervisor approval. Please note that ARS scientists who served as an internship mentor in 2024 are eligible to serve as a mentor again in 2025 and are welcome to apply.
