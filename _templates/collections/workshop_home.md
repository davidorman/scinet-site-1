# Workshop Goals

The 2020 SCINet Geospatial Workshop continues the efforts outlined from the 2019 workshop held in Las Cruces, NM. The two overarching goals of this workshop are to:

1. Provide hands-on learning experiences (tutorials) on workflows to access the Ceres high-performance computing (HPC) system and conduct geospatial and machine learning research at scale.
1. Foster research efforts that had previously been un-attainable due to computational limitations or technical bottleknecks. This includes developing infrastructure and exploring state-of-the-art machine learning methods applicable to geospatial sciences.


# Organizing Committee

* Rowan Gaffney, Physical Scientist, Ft Collins, CO
* Kerrie Geil, SCINet Postdoc, Las Cruces, NM
* Amy Hudson, SCINet Postdoc, Las Cruces, NM
* Yanghui Kang, SCINet Postdoc, Beltsville, MD
* Suzy Stillman, SCINet Postdoc, Las Cruces, NM


# How to Participate

All members of the working group as well as non-members from USDA ARS are welcome to participate! We also welcome our University collaborators who have USDA SCINet accounts. We are hoping that everyone will attend the general session of the working group (Session 1) and then pick and choose other sessions to attend based on your own interests and skill level.

The workshop is split over 6 separate Zoom sessions (as well as a pre-meeting assistance session) that will include:

* Computational infrastructure and resource development for the ARS geospatial research community (e.g. the common data library and the geospatial workbook).
* Hands-on tutorials to assist researchers in utilizing the Ceres HPC system.
* Research presentations from successful efforts using machine learning to address agricultural issues.

**To follow along with the tutorials you need to already have or [apply for a SCINet account]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/signup) and be able to successfully login to your account.**  We recommend applying for an account by 8/12/2020 at the latest, as the process can take 1-2 weeks for final approval. Please note, if you need help accessing your SCINet account you should plan on attending the pre-meeting login assistance session on 8/19/2020 (Session 0), but make sure you have applied for an account well in advance of this session.

**To follow along with the Session 4 Tutorial: Computational Reproducibility Tools make sure you [create a free personal Github account for yourself](https://github.com/join)** and remember your Github username and password. You will also, of course, need a SCINet account as described above.

**Please register for each session individually using the registration links on each session page so we can have an idea of how many people will be present at each event.** Note, each session will have a separate Zoom link and password so you must register for each session you would like to attend.

**Lastly, review the pre-meeting checklist and background information on the Pre-meeting page to ensure you are prepared for the workshop sessions.**
